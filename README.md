# My soon-to-be official website!?
*TL;DR: Cool website with **NO Javascript** being served to the client! After all, why use Javascript when you can use CSS.*

Although using React is the standard for websites, I want to support people who don't enable Javascript in their browsers for privacy/security reasons. *im also not using react because react is hard and im bad*

## ‚ú® What's special?
1. As stated earlier, absolutely no Javascript is used on the website itself, but that's only the beginning.

2. Any time a link can be avoided, a link will be avoided. For example, CSS is directly injected into the HTML rather than linking to an external CSS file.

    An exception to this are fonts. While including the raw data into the CSS as a base64 url would work, it would make developing a little difficult because I like to have word wrap enabled... and I think you know what that means.

3. All served files are minified. Yes, even the HTML. And yes, even the [fonts](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/tools/webfont-generator). While full-blown optimizations aren't done as of right now, this could be the case in the future. 

    The server also serves the content in gzip format for additional compression. This is supported by the majority of browsers (I think) and happens automatically in the background.

## ‚ùì Why

## üöÄ Technologies used
### [Pug](https://github.com/pugjs/pug)
Pug is a template engine for **HTML** which offers a much easier to use syntax over HTML. However, Pug code still needs to be compiled down to HTML for it to be usable.
> Pug is a high-performance template engine heavily influenced by [Haml](http://haml.info/)
> and implemented with JavaScript for [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) and browsers. For bug reports,
> feature requests and questions, [open an issue](https://github.com/pugjs/pug/issues/new).
> For discussion join the [chat room](https://gitter.im/pugjs/pug).

### [Sass](https://github.com/sass/sass)
Sass is a language that compiles to **CSS** that offers a much cleaner syntax. The one used here is [Dart Sass](https://github.com/sass/dart-sass) which is an official implementation of Sass written in [Dart](https://www.dartlang.org). However, they offer a Node.js library which works on top of Dart Sass.
> **Sass makes CSS fun again**. Sass is an extension of CSS, adding nested rules,
> variables, mixins, selector inheritance, and more. It's translated to
> well-formatted, standard CSS using the command line tool or a plugin for your
> build system.

### [Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/node)
Ironically, although I've avoiding Javascript on the website, Javascript is *casually* used to compile the website. Both Sass and Pug, as well as `compile.js`, run with Node.js.
> Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, JavaScript runtime environment.

## üìù Additional Notes
### Minifying
Sass doesn't compile to a minifed CSS. To get around this, I'm using [html-minifed](https://www.npmjs.com/package/html-minifier) and [clean-css](https://www.npmjs.com/package/clean-css) to minify both the CSS and the HTML in one go. The reason this works is because the CSS contents are [directly inserted](https://pugjs.org/language/includes.html) into HTML document by Pug. Since Pug's goal is not to generate minified HTML, that job is passed onto html-minified, which also uses clean-css to minify the CSS in the HTML.
